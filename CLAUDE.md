# Vladan Toolkit — project guide

A personal Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that grows one feature at a time.
**Every feature must be switchable on/off in the extension's settings.**
The repo is **public** — never commit secrets, tokens, `.env` files, or personal data.

## Stack
- **WXT** (Vite-based extension framework): manifest generated from `wxt.config.ts` + `src/entrypoints/`
- **React 19** + **TypeScript 7** + **Tailwind CSS v4** (CSS-first config, `@import "tailwindcss"`)
- **Biome** (lint + format), **Vitest** (unit; WXT fake `browser`; opt-in happy-dom), **Playwright** (e2e in real Chromium)
- **pnpm 12**, **lefthook** git hooks, **commitlint** (conventional commits), **release-please**

## Commands
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Opens Chrome with the extension loaded + hot reload (persistent profile in `.chrome-dev-profile/`) |
| `pnpm verify` | Everything: typecheck, Biome, unit tests, build, e2e. Must be green before pushing |
| `pnpm check` | Typecheck (regenerates WXT types first) + Biome (CI mode) |
| `pnpm lint:fix` | Auto-fix formatting/lint |
| `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:watch` | Vitest unit tests (`src/**/*.test.ts(x)`, `scripts/**/*.test.ts`) |
| `pnpm e2e` | Playwright e2e (`e2e/*.spec.ts`); global setup installs Chromium if missing and builds + zips first |
| `pnpm build` / `pnpm zip` | Production build to `.output/chrome-mv3` / zip for the Web Store |

## Git hooks (automatic)
- **pre-commit** (fast): Biome auto-fixes staged files, typecheck.
- **commit-msg**: must be a conventional commit: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`, `refactor: ...`, `docs: ...`, `test: ...`, `ci: ...`, `build: ...`.
  Only `feat`/`fix` (and breaking changes) trigger a release.
- **pre-push** (`scripts/check-push.ts`): refuses uncommitted/untracked files, pushing a branch that isn't
  checked out, and local `.env*` files WXT would bake into the build; then runs `pnpm verify`.
  Tag-only pushes and deletions skip verify. Never bypass with `--no-verify`; fix the failure instead.

## Layout
```
src/
  entrypoints/        # WXT entrypoints -> each becomes part of the manifest
    background.ts     # service worker
    popup/            # toolbar popup: feature switches + "All settings"
    options/          # settings page (opens in a tab): feature switches
    <feature>.content.ts  # content scripts, one per feature
  features/
    registry.ts       # THE list of features (drives the switches)
    <feature-id>/     # one folder per feature: definition, logic, assets, tests
  components/         # shared React UI (FeatureToggles)
  lib/features.ts     # Feature type, featureEnabled(), whileEnabled()
  assets/global.css   # Tailwind entry for extension pages
e2e/                  # Playwright tests; e2e/fixtures/ = offline models of real sites
scripts/              # repo tooling (pre-push guard)
public/icon/          # extension icons
```

## Adding a feature (the recipe)
1. **Define it** in `src/features/<feature-id>/index.ts`:
   ```ts
   export const myFeature = {
     id: 'my-feature',            // kebab-case, never rename (it's the storage key)
     name: 'My feature',          // shown next to the switch
     description: 'What it does, in one sentence.',
     enabledByDefault: true,
   } satisfies Feature;
   ```
2. **Register it** in `src/features/registry.ts`. The popup and settings page then show its switch automatically.
3. **Gate all behavior on the switch** (it must apply live, without reloading pages):
   - Content script: `src/entrypoints/<feature-id>.content.ts` with
     `const stop = await whileEnabled(myFeature, () => { start(); return undo; }); ctx.onInvalidated(stop);`
     For page CSS, inject a `<style>` (import the file with `?inline`) and remove it in `undo`
     (see `src/features/hide-youtube-shorts/`). Don't use manifest-injected CSS: it can't be switched off.
   - Background: check `await featureEnabled(myFeature).getValue()` before acting, and use
     `featureEnabled(myFeature).watch(...)` to add/remove listeners, context menus, alarms, etc.
4. **Other places it can run**:
   - Content-script UI → `<feature-id>.content/index.tsx` with `createShadowRootUi`. Caution: Tailwind v4 utilities
     that rely on `@property` (shadows, gradients, transforms) may not render inside a shadow root.
   - Side panel → `src/entrypoints/sidepanel/` (WXT adds the `sidePanel` permission itself). Because the toolbar
     icon opens the popup, open the panel with `browser.sidePanel.open()` from a click (e.g. a popup button).
5. **Permissions**: add only what the feature needs to `manifest.permissions` / `host_permissions` in
   `wxt.config.ts` (content-script `matches` already grant access to those sites). `storage` is already on.
   Prefer `activeTab` and optional permissions over broad host access.
6. **Tests**:
   - Unit tests next to the code (`*.test.ts`; `vitest.setup.ts` resets the fake `browser` before each test).
     Tests needing a DOM start with `// @vitest-environment happy-dom`.
   - E2E: add a spec covering the feature **on and off** (toggle via the popup's switch). For site features,
     serve an offline model of the site with `context.route(...)` (see `e2e/hide-youtube-shorts.spec.ts`);
     include look-alike elements that must NOT be affected.
   - For site features, also check once against the live site before shipping (sites change markup).
7. **Store listing**: add the feature to `store/LISTING.md` (description; permission justifications if
   permissions/sites changed), `PRIVACY.md` (if it touches new sites or data) and README's feature table.
   Run `pnpm store-assets` if the popup changed. The user pastes listing changes into the dashboard.
8. **Verify**: `pnpm verify`, then commit with `feat: <what it does>` (drives the version bump + changelog).

## Rules
- MV3 only; no remotely hosted code, no `eval`/`new Function` (Chrome Web Store policy).
- `browser.*` (WXT's global) instead of `chrome.*`.
- Settings/state via WXT storage (`import { storage } from '#imports'`), never `localStorage`.
- Tailwind utility classes for extension pages; no extra CSS frameworks.
- Keep the popup fast: no heavy work on open; defer to background where possible.
- Claude desktop app on Windows: it's a packaged app that redirects `%LOCALAPPDATA%` writes, which breaks
  Playwright's default browser cache. `.claude/settings.local.json` (git-ignored) sets
  `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=D:\.cache\ms-playwright` for the agent only; other environments use the default.

## Releasing
- Every push to `main` updates a **Release PR** (release-please). Merge it to release: it tags `vX.Y.Z`
  (first release: `v0.2.0`), writes `CHANGELOG.md` and creates the GitHub Release; then full CI runs on that tag,
  and only if green is the tested zip attached to the release and published to the Chrome Web Store.
- Web Store publishing is **opt-in**: only when the repo variable `CWS_PUBLISH` is `true`
  (`gh variable set CWS_PUBLISH --body true`). Currently off: the user installs locally (unpacked).
- Web Store credentials: secret `CHROME_SUBMIT_ENV` (the whole `.env.submit` from `pnpm wxt submit init`,
  CWS API v2 service account) in the GitHub **environment** `chrome-web-store`, usable only from `main`.
- Failed publish or credential check: Actions → **Release** → Run workflow (tag to re-publish; "dry run" = check only).
- Version comes from `package.json` (WXT copies it into the manifest). Don't bump it by hand.
  The Chrome Web Store rejects all-zero versions, so the project started at `0.1.0` (never released itself).
